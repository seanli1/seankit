        "question": "Why is my BAH different from someone at my duty location who has the same rank as I do?",
        "answer": "If you are receiving a different BAH allowance than someone from the same duty location that has the same rank as you, BAH Rate Protection is probably in effect for one of you.  The monthly BAH amount must not be reduced as a result of changes in housing costs in the MHA (Military Housing Area), changes in the national monthly housing cost, or a member's promotion.  One of you is most likely receiving a higher BAH in an area where there was a BAH reduction.  This grandfathering protects the member from BAH fluctuations.\nTo check the rate of BAH for your PDS (Note, BAH is based on your PDS Zip Code, not your home Zip Code) and rank, please visit DTMO's BAH Rates web site.\nHowever, if you believe this is not the case (i.e. the rate in your area did not decrease and you are not subject to BAH Rate Protection), then you should immediately contact your servicing Finance Office to ensure you are not over or under paid.\n",

        "question": "How can I get copies of old travel vouchers?",
        "answer": "For vouchers that were created and processed electronically through the Defense Travel System (DTS), you can view and print your paid travel vouchers by accessing DTS.\nFor non-DTS vouchers such as PCS and most deployment travel, when the voucher is paid, a copy is emailed to you at the address on file in the Reserve Travel System (RTS). If you didn't get a copy, it could be that an incorrect email address is on file in RTS or there could have been a delay in processing your voucher. You should contact your servicing Finance Office for assistance and to check your RTS email address. \nIf you are looking for a voucher filed at a different duty location, you should contact that base for help in retrieving old voucher copies.  You can use our FSO Look-up Tool to find the contact information for the FSO at different locations.\nPlease note that the statute of limitations on travel voucher retention by the FSO is 6 years and 3 months.  It is unlikely you will be able to retrieve voucher copies beyond that time frame, so therefore it is important to always save a digital or hard copy of all filed travel vouchers in your personal records. \n",

You do not accrue leave for periods of duty in a non-pay status or for tours less than 30 days.\nIf you are on back-to-back tours (no break in orders), leave will accrue and can be rolled over until the end of the back-to-back orders. Any leave not used during the confines of the last back-to-back order, must be sold back when that order ends.\nTypically, the accrued leave must be used before the end of your active duty tour.

Please see your Reserve Pay Office for exceptions to this rule.\n\nIf there is any unused accrued leave remaining at the end of your tour, it must be sold. Once your Reserve Pay Office receives your completed AF Form IMT 938 (Request and Authorization for Active Duty Training/Active Duty Tour), they will process a transaction to generate payment of your remaining leave balance.

To file for a rebuttal, you must generate a letter stating why you believe the amount that you've been asked to pay is incorrect. You also need to have a copy of the DD Form 139 (obtained from the Finance Office) as well as a copy of your PCS orders. Please submit all required documentation to the Traffic Management Office (TMO) within 30 days of receiving the debt notification. For further information on required documentation please contact TMO.\nYou have 30 days from the date of notification of the Household Goods (HHG) indebtedness to file the rebuttal letter with the Transportation Management Office (TMO).  The counselor at TMO will review the letter for completeness and forward it to Joint Personal Property Shipping Office (JPPSO) in San Antonio for a decision.  Upon adjudication, JPPSO will notify you of their decision with either an adjusted DD Form 139 increasing/decreasing the debt, or a letter of cancellation of the debt.  The TMO will also be notified.\nIt can take several months before you receive notification of indebtedness for exceeding your household weight allowance. This delay is due to carrier billing procedures and the gathering of information by the excess cost adjudication function.\n",

Your dependents can choose to be reimbursed for their expenses either via commercial or non-commercial rate SEA. The primary difference between the two rates is the lodging reimbursement and required receipts; commercial rate SEA requires a commercial lodging receipt, whereas the non-commercial rate SEA does not, but the amount of reimbursement for lodging is drastically reduced.\nCommercial Rate\nFirst 30 days:\nFirst evacuee is authorized up to 100% of the lodging portion plus a flat amount equal to 100% of the meals & incidental expense (M&IE) of the safe haven per diem rate.\nFor each evacuee age 18 or older, a flat amount equal to 100% of the M&IE of the safe haven per diem rate.\nFor each evacuee under 18, a flat amount equal to 50% of the M&IE of the safe haven per diem rate.\nNote: based on the gender and age of the additional evacuees, a higher lodging entitlement (up to 150%) is authorized. See JTR Chap 6 Part B Sec 3c Para 632 (Civilian Employees - Payments During an Ordered-Authorized Departure From a Foreign Area) for details.\nDay 31-180:\nFirst evacuee is authorized up to 80% of the lodging portion plus a flat amount equal to 80% of M&IE of the safe haven per diem rate.\nFor each evacuee age 18 or older, a flat amount equal to 80% of the M&IE of the safe haven per diem rate.\nFor each evacuee under 18, a flat amount equal to 40% of the M&IE of the safe haven per diem rate.\nNon-commercial rate SEA is computed the same as the commercial rate for the M&IE portion.

The RITA entitlement is a two-year process and consists of two allowances -- the Withholding Tax Allowance (WTA) and the RITA payment.\n\nWTA is an estimated payment of the final RITA payment and is payable only if you elect to receive it.  It is paid on each taxable claim that you have in conjunction with your PCS move and is intended as an immediate offset to the taxes withheld on your claims.  The WTA payment itself is subject to withholding.  The WTA allows you to receive the same reimbursement on your claims had withholding not been required.

To be eligible for this option, you must either have orders authorizing PCS, TDY with HHG allowance, or assignment to/from government quarters.\nFirst, you must contact the Traffic Management Office (TMO) to obtain a DD Form 2278 (Application For Do It Yourself Move And Counseling Checklist). Based on a weight estimate you provide, TMO will use this form to compute your allowance for personally moving your HHG. TMO will also compute an amount that you can receive in advance of your move to help minimize out of pocket expenses.\nThen, upon completion of your PPM, you are required to submit your PPM claim to TMO for validation. Once TMO has validated the accuracy of your claim, it will be forwarded to the Finance Office for payment. Please check with TMO to find out if they automatically forward your claim to the Finance Office. In some instances, you may be required to take your claim to the Finance Office.\nCivilian Employees:\nRefer to your PCS orders for HHG transportation information. Contact your servicing Personal Property Shipping Office (i.e. TMO) for additional information on reimbursement steps. Generally, you are limited to the government cost of actual expenses incurred, NTE the cost of a government arranged move for the same HHG weight or the commuted rate method for interstate HHG shipments between CONUS PDSs...whichever method your servicing Personal Property Shipping Office has approved as advantageous for HHG transportation.\n",

Confinement by civil authorities: suspend pay and allowances.\n\n2. Confinement by military or civil authorities as a civil witness: continue accrual of pay and allowance; however, if food is provided by military authorities then BAS and COLA without dependents, for enlisted members must be suspended.\n\n3. Military confinement awaiting investigation or court-martial: suspend BAS and COLA without dependents for enlisted members, suspend incentive pays, and stop accruals of pay and allowances if ETS occurs while in confinement.\n\n4. Military confinement-serving a court-martial sentence: BAS and COLA without dependents for enlisted members, suspend some incentive pays, and stop accruals of pay and allowances if ETS occurs while in confinement.\n\n5. Military confinement for foreign civil offense pending charge of indictment: suspend BAS and COLA without dependents for enlisted members, suspend incentive pays, and stop accruals of pay and allowances if ETS occurs while in confinement.\n\n6. Military confinement for foreign civil offense-indicted: suspend pay and allowances.\n\nDepending if you are an officer or an enlisted, there are some different effects on your pay and allowances when you're confined.\n\nIn military court-martials, the convening authority (usually the Wing Commander), has the authority to waive any or all of the forfeitures for the period of confinement not to exceed six months, so as to direct an involuntary allotment to provide for the support of the accused's dependents.\n",

        "answer": "When your duty status changes, your entitlements may be adjusted.\n\nFor example, if your duty status changes to confinement, the type of confinement determines impact on your pay. Generally, if you are in civil confinement, you stop accruing pay and leave when civil confinement status starts. If you are in military confinement, you do not accrue leave and your Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS) is stopped, as well as Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) without dependents, if you're enlisted. If you're confined as a civil witness, BAS and COLA without dependents, for enlisted members, is stopped. For any confinement status, when you are restored to duty status you start to accrue pay and leave again, but adjustments will be made to your service dates to account for lost time.\n\nIf your duty status changes to absent without leave (AWOL) or desertion, you do not accrue any pay or leave effective the date you start in that status.  In addition, your allotments will be stopped. When your AWOL or desertion status ends, you'll start to accrue pay and leave again, provided you enter a status that accrues pay and leave.  In other words, if your status changes from AWOL or desertion to civil confinement, you don't begin to accrue pay and leave again. \n",

One of you is most likely receiving a higher BAH in an area where there was a BAH reduction.  This grandfathering protects the member from BAH fluctuations.\nTo check the rate of BAH for your PDS (Note, BAH is based on your PDS Zip Code, not your home Zip Code) and rank, please visit DTMO's BAH Rates web site.\nHowever, if you believe this is not the case (i.e. the rate in your area did not decrease and you are not subject to BAH Rate Protection), then you should immediately contact your servicing Finance Office to ensure you are not over or under paid.\n",

If a notice of levy is received, you will be notified and provided an opportunity to complete a statement of personal exemptions. This will exempt a specific amount from the levy for each of your dependents as well as an amount for yourself. In addition, the law will exempt an amount to allow you to comply with court-ordered child support requirements. You will also have an opportunity to specify the order in which voluntary allotments are to be canceled, if you desire, to repay the levy. Generally, stopping allotments is voluntary, except in cases specified by the IRS.\n\nThe total amount will be listed on the notice of levy that you receive from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The monthly deduction amount is determined after you complete your statement of personal exemptions on TD Form 668-P. Your 'take home pay', minus the exempt amounts for you, your dependents and court-ordered child support, will be attached and sent to the IRS to satisfy the levy. \nThe levy will be applied against your pay as soon as possible and will continue until the levy is totally satisfied or lifted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\nQuestions regarding your tax levy, including any requests to change the amount of the levy or the monthly repayment, must be directed to the IRS.\n",

        "answer": "Processing lead times can cause the stop to occur after the period when the entitlement ceased, causing an indebtedness.\nWhen you file your travel voucher, your Finance Office processes a transaction to stop your HFP or IDP.  If you have already filed your travel voucher and have received HFP or IDP for any month after the month you depart the hostile fire area or designated IDP area, please contact your Finance Office.\nUntil 31 December 2011, both HFP and IDP were paid for the entire month, even if you were not in a designated IDP area for the entire month. A change in the law now requires us to prorate IDP and pay it based on the number of days you perform duty in a designated IDP area.  That means that if you perform duty in a designated IDP area for 17 days in a month, you will be paid 17 days of the daily rate for IDP.  HFP continues to be paid on a monthly, non-prorated basis.  This can be confusing, so let's use a couple of examples.\nIf you were entitled to HFP because your aircraft was fired upon, you will be paid HFP for the entire month of the incident.\nHowever, if you were entitled to IDP and left the designated area on the 10th of the month, you are entitled to IDP for 10 days in the month. If the IDP continues to pay for the remainder of the month, when it is stopped, it will be retroactive to the day you departed the IDP area.\nReservists - HFP/IDP is stopped when you submit a copy of your final settlement travel voucher to your servicing Finance Office upon return from TDY.\n",

Advance pay is only authorized in the event of a PCS move or a deployment for more than 365 days to an area subject to hostile fire/imminent danger pay. PCS moves from OCONUS to CONUS for the purpose of separation or retirement are not authorized PCS advance pay.\nThe amount of advance pay that you may receive is limited to a maximum amount of three month's basic pay less deductions. Advance pay, once approved, will be electronically deposited into your bank account.\nRequests for advance pay are documented on a DD Form 2560 (Advance Pay Certification/Authorization Form).\nYour unit Commander is the approval authority for advance pay in the following circumstances:\nYou are in pay grades E-1 through E-3 regardless of amount or repayment schedule.\nYou are in a pay grade of E-4 or higher and:\nAmount requested is more than one month's base pay less deductions\nRepayment is requested for more than 12 months\nPayment is requested between 30 and 90 days of PCS departure or 60 to 180 days after PCS arrival\nNormally, it is only under extenuating circumstances that a commander will approve you to receive your advance 90 days prior to, or within 180 days after you PCS\nIn all other circumstances your signature is all that is required\nBring your completed DD Form 2560 (Advance Pay Certification/Authorization Form), along with a copy of your PCS orders, to your local Finance Office.\nWhen requesting an overseas housing allowance (OHA), it must be approved by the unit commander and the housing officer.  You must show proof of expenses before you can receive a housing advance to include copy of your lease, utility statements, and any other pertinent documentation.  Normally, an advance housing allowance may not be paid more than three workdays prior to you being required to make a payment under a lease or payment plan.\nRepayment will typically be made within 12 months, beginning in the month after receipt of the advance. For example, if you receive a $1,200 advance pay in June, the repayment will begin in July. In this example your repayment amount would $100 per month ($1,200 divided by 12 months equals $100 per month), or $50 per pay period if you get paid twice per month.\nAlternatively, you may use eFinance to submit your advance pay request electronically.\n",

The amount attributable to tax-exempt contributions will not be taxable.\n\nThe TSP will account for your tax-exempt contributions and will ensure that these amounts are not reported to the IRS as taxable income. Consequently, those contributions will not be subject to taxation when you withdraw them. Your quarterly participant statement will show your tax-exempt balance separately.\nGo to the Thrift Savings Plan Website for further information. \nTo change your withholding for TSP, please use myPay.\nTo change the allocation of your contributions between TSP funds, use the Thrift Savings Plan Website.\n",

        "answer": "There are several steps involved in computing TLE. Below is the computation for the most common scenario. See the link below for computation questions related to your specific situation.\nStep 1: Determine the applicable M&IE and lodging locality per diem rates for your location. The applicable M&IE and lodging locality per diem rates can be found at the link below.\n\nStep 2: Determine your applicable per diem percentage. Using the table below, calculate the percentage you are allowed to claim based on your specific situation.\n Number of Eligible Persons Occupying Temporary Quarters         Percentage Applicable\n Member or 1 dependent  65%\nMember and 1 dependent, or 2 dependents only  100%\nFor each additional dependent age 12 and over add  35%\nFor each additional dependent under age 12 add  25%\nFor a member with multiple dependents occupying the same temporary lodging, add each dependent starting with the oldest dependent to get the correct percentage rate as shown above. A member with two dependents, one over 12 and one under 12, will have an applicable percentage of 125% since the member and dependent over 12 is 100%, and the additional dependent under 12 is 25%.\n\nStep 3: Determine daily Meals & Incidental Expenses (M&IE) and ceiling for lodging. Multiply the appropriate percentage calculated in Step 2 by the applicable M&IE locality per diem rate and by the applicable lodging locality per diem rate determined in Step 1. This will give you your maximum allowed amount for both types of expenses.\n\nStep 4: Determine lodging. Compare the actual daily lodging cost (including lodging taxes) to the lodging cost ceiling calculated in Step 3. The lesser of the two amounts is your authorized lodging expense.\n\nStep 5: Determine gross daily equivalency. Add the lodging amount in Step 4 to the daily M&IE rate calculated in Step 3.\n\nStep 6: Determine applicable daily rate. The standard TLE ceiling is currently $290. Per the JTR, TLE cannot exceed this amount. Compare $290 with the amount found in Step 5. You are authorized to claim the lesser of these two amounts for that specific day.\n",

        "answer": "Your dependent's per diem allowance is based off your allowance as the uniformed member.\nFor travel by Privately Owned Conveyance (POC), your per diem is at the flat standard CONUS rate.\nFor travel by commercial means, your per diem is at the rate for the new PDS or the rate for the delay point if you stop overnight. You are not authorized per diem for delays of leave or personal reasons.\nPer diem for the dependents is 3/4 of the member's applicable rate for each dependent age 12 or older and 1/2 of the member's rate for each dependent under age 12.\nIf your spouse or designated child (age 12 and over) travels separately from you, they will be authorized to the same rate of per diem as you, not the reduced rate. Other dependents traveling with them would be factored the same as if they were with you.\nGo to Per Diem Rates for more information.\nAdditionally, your dependent will be authorized mileage if traveling by POC. Mileage is a flat rate for each POC used by authorized travelers. If you use more than two POCs, then you must obtain special authorization through your servicing Personnel Office in order to be reimbursed. Mileage can be found in JTR Chap 2 Part I Para 2605 (MALT Rate).\n",

Advance pay is only authorized in the event of a PCS move or a deployment for more than 365 days to an area subject to hostile fire/imminent danger pay. PCS moves from OCONUS to CONUS for the purpose of separation or retirement are not authorized PCS advance pay.\nThe amount of advance pay that you may receive is limited to a maximum amount of three month's basic pay less deductions. Advance pay, once approved, will be electronically deposited into your bank account.\nRequests for advance pay are documented on a DD Form 2560 (Advance Pay Certification/Authorization Form).\nYour unit Commander is the approval authority for advance pay in the following circumstances:\nYou are in pay grades E-1 through E-3 regardless of amount or repayment schedule.\nYou are in a pay grade of E-4 or higher and:\nAmount requested is more than one month's base pay less deductions\nRepayment is requested for more than 12 months\nPayment is requested between 30 and 90 days of PCS departure or 60 to 180 days after PCS arrival\nNormally, it is only under extenuating circumstances that a commander will approve you to receive your advance 90 days prior to, or within 180 days after you PCS\nIn all other circumstances your signature is all that is required\nBring your completed DD Form 2560 (Advance Pay Certification/Authorization Form), along with a copy of your PCS orders, to your local Finance Office.\nWhen requesting an overseas housing allowance (OHA), it must be approved by the unit commander and the housing officer.  You must show proof of expenses before you can receive a housing advance to include copy of your lease, utility statements, and any other pertinent documentation.  Normally, an advance housing allowance may not be paid more than three workdays prior to you being required to make a payment under a lease or payment plan.\nRepayment will typically be made within 12 months, beginning in the month after receipt of the advance. For example, if you receive a $1,200 advance pay in June, the repayment will begin in July. In this example your repayment amount would $100 per month ($1,200 divided by 12 months equals $100 per month), or $50 per pay period if you get paid twice per month.\nAlternatively, you may use eFinance to submit your advance pay request electronically.\n",

The card may also be used for some non reimbursable incidental travel expenses such as rental movies, exercise fees and beverages, when these charges are part of a room billing or meal cost and are reasonable. Remember that not all authorized charges on your GTCC may be reimbursable.  \n\nYour GTCC may also be used when you incur expenses during leave in conjunction with a TDY when the charges are an integral part of the billing for the entire period at the TDY location. For example, if you are authorized leave at a TDY location before or after the TDY, and your room or car rental is continued into the TDY period, you could use your card for the rental car or lodging costs during the leave period. Those expenses are not reimbursable to you and you are responsible to pay those costs to the card issuer.\n\nIf in doubt, do not charge the expense to your GTCC.

Your spouse and each child 12 or over are authorized 75% of your allowances, and each child under 12 is authorized 50% of your allowance. If your driving involves OCONUS locations, your per diem rate would be the OCONUS locality rate.\nPCS allowances while flying: Your per diem will be based on the locality rate of your gaining PDS or authorized stop over point. You will get per diem for the actual travel time used, not to include any travel for leave. Normally, for travel in CONUS, one travel day is allowed for travel by air. Your spouse and children 12 and over are authorized 75% of your per diem allowance; children under 12 are authorized 50% of your per diem allowance.\n\nIf you purchase your own airfare, you will be reimbursed not to exceed the cost of government procured tickets for the official travel. NOTE: You cannot purchase transoceanic or non-US carrier airfare for your own transportation; any transoceanic or OCONUS travel arrangements must be made through your servicing Transportation Management Office (TMO).  \nListed below is a general description of PCS travel and transportation allowances. Actual allowances depend on your individual travel circumstances. \nMember and Dependent Travel and Transportation Allowances: When you travel under a PCS order, the government either furnishes transportation, reimbursement, or a payment in lieu of transportation at rates found at the per diem link below. \nGenerally, you select the transportation mode (i.e., airplane, train, bus, POC) for travel between the old and new Permanent Duty Stations (PDS).\nHouse Hold Goods (HHG) Transportation and Storage: You are authorized HHG transportation and/or storage. Actual weight allowance will depend on your grade and dependency status.

The POV must be for personal use by either you or your dependents.\nDislocation Allowance: DLA partially reimburses you for the relocation expenses of a PCS or evacuation. The rate is based on your grade and dependency status.\nRates are available at the DLA link below.\nTLA: Temporary Lodging Allowance (TLA) partially offsets the added living expenses within OCONUS incurred by a member and dependents incident to a PCS. To estimate your TLA allowance, please use our TLA Calculator.\nTLE Allowance: Temporary Lodging Expense (TLE) allowance partially offsets the added living expenses within CONUS incurred by a member and dependents incident to a PCS. To estimate your TLE allowance, please use our TLE Calculator.\n\n\nTo file a PCS settlement voucher, please use the PCS In-Processing System (PIPS).\n",

For example, if you take five days of tax free leave in a month when you are not entitled to the Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE), only 25 days of pay will be taxable.  The term pay refers to the pay and allowances that are normally subject to income tax withholding such as basic pay, and incentive and special pays. \nIf you are an officer using tax free leave, your limit on the amount of wages that will be exempted is equal to the maximum enlisted amount for the month in which you earned the leave, minus the amount of wages already excluded for that month.  To determine the maximum enlisted amount, add the highest rate of basic pay payable to the highest enlisted grade and the amount of imminent danger pay payable to the officer.  As a practical matter, the benefit of tax free leave for officers may be limited because of this limit on the amount of tax exemption authorized.  \n",

If you came into the Cadet Wing with a debt caused by overpayment of pay and allowances from Prep-School or Active Duty (usually a result of excess leave) you will also have a debt on your cadet pay account.\n\nAdvance Pay - Your initial purchases as a cadet, e.g. uniforms and computer, are paid as an advance from your pay account.  A debt is established for the repayment.  This debt type is prorated and no debt letter will be created.\n\nExceeding Monthly Base Pay - When a cadet's expenses exceed their monthly pay, debts are created.

If you fail to file by April 30 of the year following your WTA payment, then you must repay ALL of the WTA you received.\n",

Although funds are withheld from your pay twice per month, the disbursement to the bank or receiving institution takes place at the end of the month (paid on the 1st of the following month).

After the second $50 is deducted from your end of month paycheck (for a total monthly deduction of $100), the full $100 payment is made to the bank on the 1st of the following month.\nMost allotments can be set up through myPay.\nHome Mortgage and Insurance allotments must be completed through eFinance or at your servicing Finance Office.\n",

        "answer": "Allotments allow you to send money to a financial institution directly from your paycheck. Each month, half of the allotment amount is deducted from your mid-month paycheck and the other half from your end of month paycheck. The system pays out the total allotment amount to the financial institution on the first day of the following month.\nYou may have up to 15 allotments at one single time, with up to 6 of these being discretionary.  Discretionary allotments include allotments for dependent support, savings, insurance and home mortgage payments. Non-discretionary allotments include allotments for the purchase of U.S. savings bonds through the Treasury Direct Website.\nMost discretionary allotments can be set up through myPay and are disbursed via electronic funds transfer (EFT) to your financial institution.\nHome Mortgage and Insurance allotments must be completed through eFinance or at your servicing Finance Office.\n",

However, if you wish for your allotment to stop in the current month, you must ensure it is stopped prior to the end of month cutoff. End of month cutoff varies slightly but usually falls around the 20th of each month.\nMost allotments can be stopped through myPay.  Home mortgage, privatized housing or insurance allotments must be stopped through eFinance or at your servicing Finance Office.\nNOTE: Generally, military pay documents received by your Finance Office by the 1st of the month will be reflected in your mid-month pay and documents received after the 1st and before the 16th of the month normally will be reflected in your end-of-month pay.\n",

        "question": "What is Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE)?",
        "answer": "The combat zone tax exclusion (CZTE) allows military personnel to exclude from tax liability all or a portion of their pay and entitlements earned while serving in designated combat zones (CZ). A CZ is any area designated by Executive Order as an area in which Armed Forces of the United States are, or have, engaged in combat. The exclusion is applied monthly for any month in which you served in a designated CZ.\nFor enlisted personnel and warrant officers, all pay is exempt from taxes. For officers, the amount excluded from taxes is limited to the sum of the highest rate of enlisted basic pay plus the amount of Hostile Fire Pay/Imminent Danger Pay (HFP/IDP) actually payable to the officer for the qualifying month.\n\nCZTE applies to withholding for both federal and state income tax. However, your basic pay remains subject to withholding for Social Security and Medicare taxes.   \nIf you are hospitalized, or rehospitalized, because of a wound, disease or injury that you incurred while serving in a combat zone, your tax free status (CZTE) continues while you are hospitalized.  Your exclusion ends when you are discharged from the hospital or changed to outpatient status.  If you are rehospitalized due to the same injury you may also qualify for the tax exclusion for up to two years after hostilities have ended. Reference DODFMR Vol 7A Chap 44 Para 440103C7 link below and the Wounded Warrior Handbook, published by DFAS.  There are additional support materials on the DFAS Wounded Warrior website.\n",
